Serious game on Angles using godot


Hello guys! github is hard to setup...

You can download directly without an account but if you wanna add files, you guys need to make one.
Just upload your scenes and sprites here using the upload button.

If you wanna get the whole project, download as ZIP and extract to your godot folder then scan for the folder when opening godot. 
It should work. :)
